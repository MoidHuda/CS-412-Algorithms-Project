# CS-412-Algorithms-Project
Final Project for the course CS-412 Algorithms: Design and Analysis

## Algorithms for finding a Maximum Matching in a Bipartite Graph.
- Hungarian Maximum Matching Algorithm
- Hopcroft-Karp Algorithm
- Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm

The above mentioned algorithms will be analysed for their complexities and then tested empirically for verification of the time complexities.
